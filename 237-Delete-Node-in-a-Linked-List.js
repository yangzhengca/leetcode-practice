// 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
// Easy
// Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

// It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
// Output: [4,1,9]
// Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
// Example 2:


// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
// Output: [4,5,9]
// Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
 

// Constraints:

// The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
// -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
// The value of each node in the list is unique.
// The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
